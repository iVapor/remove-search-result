It's chrome extension which can remove [Baidu](https://www.baidu.com/)'s 
search result of specific site. It's easy to use.

* Use React and Webpack in Popup page. 
* Support hot reload. 
* A better UI with Ant Design.

The Baidu's users are mostly Chinese. So, our current UI is Chinese. If you want an English version this extension,
please issue to me. I'm glad to do in subsequent updates.
