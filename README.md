It's chrome extension which can remove [Baidu](https://www.baidu.com/)'s 
search results of specific site. It's easy to use. Just input site name or
 url, it will do the rest things.

* Of course, you can add any website to block. But, it won't remove the official website at first place.
* It works both site name and url.
* You can modify existing remove list. 
* You can always disable this remove actions at anytime. You don't have to disable the hole extension.

# Tech
* Use [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) in Popup page. 
* Support hot reload [by mv3-hot-reload](https://github.com/pacexy/mv3-hot-reload)
* A better UI with [Ant Design](https://ant.design).

The Baidu's users are mostly Chinese. So, our current UI is Chinese. 
If you want an English version of this extension,
please issue me. I'm glad to do in subsequent updates.
